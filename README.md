The stats appear as an item on the left-hand side of the status bar.

You can change the stats shown by clicking the item, or running the command.

## Commands

This command can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- `Marky Stats: Change Statistic`

## Activation

The extension is only loaded when a markdown file is open. To be more specific, the [activation event](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events) is `onLanguage: markdown`.

## FAQ

### Why isn't Marky Stats appearing in the Status Bar?

On a crowded status bar, the Marky Stats may have been forced out! You can test this by zooming out, so the text becomes very small, and you will see more items on the status bar.

Go to the User Settings, and hide or disable other status bar items to make space.

### Can I change the location of the item in the Status Bar?

There is an `alignment` field in the API that can position the item on the left-hand side or right-hand side of the status bar. I haven't included it as an extension setting because `alignment` is a read-only property. You can only set this property when you create the status bar item. I don't think it is worth the effort to destroy and recreate the item to facilitate this.
